# MAX31820WeatherStation
An Arduino Sketch for a Sparkfun ESP8266 Thing Dev board, using a MAX31820 temperature sensor to sense and report the current ambient temperature to the Weather Underground.

This is a WORK IN PROGRESS. The state of the project: The code is written, but at the moment untested. The 3D printed project box is designed. See Diary.odt for details, remaining work, and progress.

The current Arduino Sketch requires a Sparkfun ESP8266 Thing Dev board, a MAX31820 temperature sensor, a 4.7K Ohm pull-up resistor and a few wires. Details are in BillOfMaterials.ods.

Next steps: Test the program.
